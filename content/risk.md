  # **_TECHNOLOGY RISK:_**


  ➢ The most common risk faced by the online e-commerce market is the theft of
  the identity of the individual customer. crabbing personal information without
  the knowledge of the customer.


  ➢ Venture should progress with proper Intellectual property of
  E-commerce.while comparing the 

  grocery product with different websites need to get proper access from
  different websites so that 

  the intellectual property of the competitor company may not reflect on
  violation of the intellectual 

  property law


  ➢ Online security of E-commerce is a protocol used to safeguard the wireless
  transaction made 

  against the grocery product. without efficient protocol, there is a loophole
  in the transaction which 

  affect the customer transaction


  ➢ Power outage will lead to grocery product damage


  # **_Market Risk:_**


  ➢ Nowadays there are so many online grocery shopping websites and applications
  are available for 

  the customer.so there are so many competitors in the field. But comparing the
  grocery product on 

  different websites and retail stores is a new concept. If anyone follows this
  concept then it will be a 

  big problem for the venture, This will reduce the sales and lead the venture
  under risk


  ➢ If the competitor venture in the market offers many discounts to the
  customer. Then it will lead 

  the venture under risk 


  ➢ Keeping the grocery product fresh in the market under different conditions.


  # **_Team Risk:_**


  ➢ Before starting the venture efficient team members should be hired for the
  various purpose in the 

  venture and they are assigned work according to the ability team risk can come
  in to play when the 

  efficient team member leaves the company for different reasons(example: may
  leave the company 

  for better offer or promotion)

   ➢ If the team member joins the competitor's venture then it will be a big threat to our venture. 
  because the team member knows the venture strategies and techniques.


  # **_Regulation and legal uncertainties:_**


  ➢ The most major problem faced by government regulation policies is
  uncertainty in international marketing. If
   there is a problem in selling the product in another country, because that country must have prohibited the 
  particular product so this may lead to violation of law


  # **_Financial risk:_**


  ➢ There is some financial risk involved in our venture, first of all at the
  initial stage of developing our 

  venture we are going to start the venture with some stakeholders. After some
  time if the 

  stakeholder leave the venture then will be a risk for the venture


  ➢ Getting a loan from the bank is the other factor of the financial risk for
  our venture, every month 

  some amount needs to be paid against the loan amount.so if there is a decline
  in sales for a month 

  then it will be difficult


  ➢ A large area of well-equipped refrigerator warehouse is mandatory to
  maintain the grocery 
     product.so it is difficult at the initial stage
